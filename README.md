three machines share this repo: two nixos hosts and one macbook under
nix-darwin. dotfiles are managed by [hjem](https://github.com/feel-co/hjem) in
symlink-only mode: native config files in `config/` are the single source of
truth, and hjem just links them into place.

## foreword

i'm learning linux and nix in the open. this repo is the practice ground. the
goal is to understand rather than to assemble the flashiest setup, so things are
kept deliberately small and explicit. if a choice looks naive, it probably
reflects where i was in the learning curve when i made it.

## hosts

| name | machine | platform | gpu | role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `navi` | thinkpad x1 carbon gen 12 (meteor lake) | nixos | intel arc (integrated) | learning machine, laptop |
| `games` | asus tuf gaming h770-pro, i7-13700kf | nixos | nvidia rtx 4070 | desktop, gaming, dual boot with windows |
| `sommei` | macbook pro (m1 pro) | nix-darwin (`aarch64-darwin`) | — | multimedia daily driver |

| | navi | games |
|---|---|---|
| hyprland scale / mode | 1.8 / preferred | 1.0 / `2560x1440@360` |
| keyboard | `us,fr` | `fr` only |
| `mainMod` | `SUPER` | `SUPER` via caps lock (`caps:super`, 60% keyboard) |
| wayle config | `config/wayle/config-navi.toml` | `config/wayle/config-games.toml` |
| extras | power management, `powertop` | nvidia (open kernel module, stable branch), steam + proton-ge, coolercontrol (`nct6775`), spicetify |

per-host values in `hyprland.lua` are picked by reading `/etc/hostname`. the
wayle file is selected through a custom option, `fyrr.wayle.configFile`,
declared in `modules/desktop/hjem.nix`.

**sommei** runs macos. nix-darwin handles the declarative system config, and
homebrew — itself installed and pinned by nix-homebrew — covers the gui casks
that nix handles poorly on mac.

```

modules are opt-in: each host imports only what it needs, and a module imports
its own dependencies (e.g. `spicetify.nix` pulls the spicetify-nix module
itself). shared modules propose values with `lib.mkDefault`; a host overrides
them plainly, `lib.mkForce` stays for real emergencies.

the darwin host declares its own hjem block inline, since its paths and its
subset of tools differ.

## flake inputs

| input | purpose |
|---|---|
| `nixpkgs` | `nixos-unstable` (also used by `sommei`) |
| `nix-darwin` | macos system management for `sommei` |
| `hjem` | dotfile symlinks |
| `nix-homebrew` | installs and pins homebrew itself on `sommei` |
| `spicetify-nix` | patched spotify on `games` |
| `treefmt-nix` | formatter + `nix flake check` gate |
| `sops-nix` | age-encrypted secrets on every host; `sops` and `age` in the dev shell |

every input that has a `nixpkgs` or `nix-darwin` input follows ours, so there is
a single copy of each in the lock. sops-nix follows `nixpkgs`.

## theming

`theme.nix` sits at the repo root and holds two palettes, `blood` (default) and
`copland` — a serial experiments lain reference. a single `variant` string picks
one. both palettes expose the same 26 semantic keys (catppuccin convention) plus
the 16 ansi colours, so any consumer that interpolates `theme.palette.<key>`
rethemes automatically.

the file is imported once in `flake.nix` and threaded to every host through
`specialArgs` as `theme`. `wezterm.lua`, `hyprlock.conf` and `hypr-theme.lua`
(hyprland border colours) are generated from it with `pkgs.writeText`.

## daily workflow

`just` is the entry point. run it with no argument to list the recipes.

```sh
just switch    # rebuild + activate this host (asks for sudo)
just build     # build only, no activation, no sudo
just fmt       # run nixfmt over every .nix file (writes)
just lint      # statix + deadnix
just check     # format check + lint, mirrors what ci should do
just update    # nix flake update (bumps every input)
```

the recipes detect the platform with `uname` and the machine name on their own,
so the same command works on all three hosts. `switch` and `build` use
`justfile_directory()`, so they work from any subdirectory.

order matters: **`fmt` corrects, `check` only verifies.** `check` builds a
derivation that formats a copy of the sources in the nix sandbox and fails on
any diff — it can never write to the repo. so the loop is:

```
git pull --rebase → edit → just fmt → just check → just build → commit → just switch
```

two habits worth keeping:

- **after a refactor**, `nix store diff-closures /run/current-system ./result`
  must print nothing: same system, cleaner code.
- **before an update lands**, the same command lists every package whose version
  changes.

### rebuilding by hand

```sh
# nixos (navi, games)
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<hostname>

# darwin (sommei) — activation must run as root
sudo darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#sommei
```

on macos the flake attribute must match `scutil --get LocalHostName`, not the
output of `hostname` — that one can be overwritten by dhcp or mdns.

`nix flake lock` adjusts the lock after editing `inputs` without bumping
anything else; `nix flake update` bumps everything.

### is this host in sync with the repo?

```sh
just build
readlink -f /run/current-system              # running system
readlink -f result                           # what the repo builds
readlink -f /nix/var/nix/profiles/system     # what the next boot starts
```

all three paths identical = the machine is exactly the repo, now and after a
reboot. if a rebuild breaks the boot, pick the previous generation in the
systemd-boot menu.

### development shell

```sh
nix develop
```

gives `nixd` (language server), `nixfmt`, `statix`, `deadnix`, `just`, `sops`
and `age` without installing them system-wide. secret editing is
documented in `docs/secrets.md` (in French). sops-nix is the secrets approach.

## state that nix does not manage

a fresh install brings back the config, not this. redo it by hand:

| what | where | how |
|---|---|---|
| tailscale identity | `/var/lib/tailscale` | `sudo tailscale up` |
| mullvad lan sharing | mullvad settings | `mullvad lan set allow` (otherwise tailscale goes through a derp relay when mullvad is on) |
| windows clock (`games` dual boot) | windows registry | `RealTimeIsUniversal = 1` so both os read the rtc as utc |
| wayle gui tweaks | `~/.config/wayle/runtime.toml` | copy what is worth keeping into `config/wayle/config-<host>.toml` |
| ssh keys | `~/.ssh` | regenerate and add to github |
| sops age host key | `/var/lib/sops-nix/key.txt` | `age-keygen` as root; see `docs/secrets.md` |
| mumble audio backend (nixos) | `~/.config/Mumble/Mumble/mumble_settings.json` | input/output system = `PulseAudio`, otherwise mumble 1.5 gets SIGKILLed with pipewire >= 1.4 |
| game prefixes | `~/Games`, steam library | reinstall from steam / lutris |

## gotchas

**nix and flakes**

- **flakes only see git-tracked files.** after creating a file, `git add` before
  rebuilding, or nix fails with `Path '...' does not exist in the Git repository`.
- **read nix errors from the bottom.** look for `Failed assertions:` or the last
  `error:`; everything above is the evaluation trace.
- **`permittedInsecurePackages` pins an exact version** and silently stops
  applying at the next bump.
- **deadnix flags unused arguments** (`{ pkgs, lib, ... }:`). removing the last
  use of `lib` or `inputs` means removing it from the header too.
- **bootstrapping a tool that drives rebuilds** is circular: adding `just` to a
  host's packages does nothing until a rebuild has run. break the loop once with
  `nix run nixpkgs#just -- switch`.

**dotfiles (hjem)**

- **hjem links point into the nix store**, not into the live repo. editing a
  dotfile and reloading the tool is not enough; the change lands after a rebuild.
  hyprland needs a full logout, `hyprctl reload` does not re-read the lua.
- **hjem links files, not directories**, so it does not clobber things like
  fish's `conf.d/` or `functions/`.
- **never declare a file the app rewrites itself.** the app replaces the symlink
  with a real file and the next rebuild conflicts with it. seen with zen's
  `profiles.ini` (seeded once by an activation script on `sommei`) and wayle's
  `runtime.toml` (left to wayle, only `config.toml` is declared).

**desktop**

- **hyprland ignores `services.xserver.xkb`.** the session keyboard lives in
  `hyprland.lua`; the xkb option only covers sddm.
- **keybinds on digits use keycodes** (`code:10` … `code:19`). on azerty the
  unshifted top row is `& é " ...`, so `mainMod + 1` would never fire.
- **the nixos hyprland wrapper grants `cap_sys_nice`**, which puts glibc in
  secure mode: it strips `TZDIR` (and makes the process unreadable in `/proc`).
  `hyprland.lua` sets `TZDIR` back, otherwise every app falls back to utc.
- **hyprland ships no polkit agent.** `hyprpolkitagent` is exposed through
  `systemd.packages` and started from `hyprland.lua`, since
  `graphical-session.target` is never reached here.
- **`TAG+="uaccess"` udev rules must sort before `73-seat-late.rules`.**
  `services.udev.extraRules` writes `99-local.rules`, too late, so the gaming
  rules ship as `70-gaming.rules` through `services.udev.packages`.
- **`pkexec` is not setuid by default** on current nixos
  (`security.polkit.enablePkexecWrapper`). use `sudo`.

**darwin**

- **`homebrew.onActivation.cleanup = "uninstall"`** removes any cask that is not
  in the declared list. brew now prints a deprecation warning for the underlying
  flag.

## system

- network: networkmanager, systemd-resolved, tailscale (tailnet trusted in the
  firewall), mullvad (daemon + gui)
- memory: zram swap (zstd, up to 50 % of ram), no disk swap, no hibernation
- desktop: sddm → hyprland, wezterm, nushell (login shell) + starship, wayle bar,
  hyprlock + hypridle (auto-lock, lock before sleep), hyprpolkitagent
- printing: cups
- nix: weekly garbage collection (older than 7 days), store auto-optimisation
- locale: `en_US.UTF-8` with french regional settings, timezone `Europe/Paris`
- `sommei`: touch id for sudo, declarative dock / finder / trackpad / keyboard
  repeat / screenshot settings

## known gaps

- **sops-nix is the chosen secrets approach.** it is wired on all three hosts, but no secret is defined yet. age recipients in `.sops.yaml` are still placeholders. workflow: `docs/secrets.md`.
- **`just check` evaluates the hosts but does not build them**: a wrong option
  or a typo fails, a package that fails to compile still passes.
- **theming is only half declarative.** kitty, rofi, spicetify and wayle still
  carry hand-written colour files instead of reading `theme.nix`.
- **git history carries several author names.** the identity itself is declared
  in `config/git/config`, linked by hjem.
